# This is a stub

Mostly a todo / idea.

Todo: add some resources and some quick overviews to help with mental model of THREE, and then illustrations of how A-Frame works in response to that.

A great way to get started is to take THREE examples and try to replicate them in A-Frame.

One example: The built-in A-Frame line component only draws one line (two points).
THREE allows multi-segment lines (more than two points).
This reduces draw calls, and so is more efficient.
